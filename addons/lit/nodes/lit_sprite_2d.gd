class_name LitSprite2D

## A Sprite2D that ships pre-wired with the lit_receiver ShaderMaterial and a
## CanvasTexture, so its diffuse/normal/specular slots show up in the inspector right
## away and it's lit by Lit with no manual setup. This is the from-scratch path; the
## "Make Selected Nodes Lit" editor tool is the batch path for existing art. It is just
## a shortcut, equivalent to assigning the receiver material to a plain Sprite2D by hand.
##
## Exposes the receiver shader's per-instance parameters (emissive_strength,
## receiver_mask) as @exports that proxy to this node's own ShaderMaterial, so every
## LitSprite2D can be tuned and masked independently.

# Loaded lazily in _init rather than via a top-level `const preload`. Because this script
# has a `class_name`, the editor parses it at startup to build the global class list, and a
# `preload` const would compile the receiver shader right then, before the plugin's
# _enter_tree has registered the lit_* global uniforms. On a fresh install that produces a
# benign "Global uniform does not exist" error. Deferring to _init means the shader isn't
# compiled until a LitSprite2D is actually instantiated, by which point the globals exist.

## a bit with this mask. Proxies to `receiver_mask`.
